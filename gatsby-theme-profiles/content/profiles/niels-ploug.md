I have been working nationally and internationally as a manager in knowledge
production for 30 years - Director of Social Statistics at
[Statistics Denmark](https://www.dst.dk/en) since 2008 - and before that in
management positions at the
[Danish National Institute for Social Research](https://www.vive.dk/en/welcome/).

As a manager in a knowledge producing organization I have enjoyed being involved
in many development projects - and on top of my management responsibilities I
enjoy to be part of specific development projects at my work place and
internationally in relation to statistics and social research.

In recent years I have got heavily involved in the United Nations work on the
statistical coverage of The Sustainable Development Goals - The SDG's - as well
as global work on the use of Big Data for official statistics. And in the work
at the European level on the use of administrative data for the production of
official statistics.

I have for many years been teaching at the economics department at the
[University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) and at
[Copenhagen Business school](https://www.cbs.dk/) - as well as at
[University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona](https://www.upf.edu/en/).

On top of that I'm still participating in research through international
research publications - and as a speaker at conferences and seminars all over
the world.
