[National Statistical Office of Malawi](http://www.nsomalawi.mw/)s Demographic

He successfully coordinated and managed the 2018 Population and Housing Census

data collection, entry and transmission and is also one of the first in Africa
to use the technology for a PHC. Satellite imagery was used for census mapping.
All maps were drawn in the office. Field work was used to verify the boundaries
and features. We produced the preliminary report in a record two and half months
and released it in three months. The main report was released after 8 months.
