data governance, management, regulation and usability. Tom manages the Global
Partnership for Sustainable Development Dataâ€™s interoperability stream,
co-facilitating the Collaborative on Interoperability together with
[United Nations Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/) and
[Open Data Watch](https://opendatawatch.com/).

Prior to establishing DataReady, Tom led the
[Joined-Up Data Standards project at Publish What You Fund](https://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/projects/joined-up-data-standards/)
contributing to the establishment of the Interoperability Collaborative.

Previously, he worked for [Global Partners Digital](https://www.gp-digital.org/)
