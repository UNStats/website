Fernando joined the
[International Development Research Centre (IDRC)](https://www.idrc.ca/en) in
2007, where he pioneered work on open data and big data with leading regional
and local partners committed to the creation of locally-driven and sustainable
data ecosystems in developing countries.

This includes several global initiatives on open data, big data, feminist open
government, and artificial intelligence for development. In the past years, he
coordinated [Open Data for Development](https://www.od4d.net), an initiative
hosted at the IDRC which is co-funded by
[Global Affairs Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/gac-amc/index.aspx?lang=eng)
and the [Hewlett Foundation](https://hewlett.org/). He has served in the
organizing committee of the past three editions of the
[International Open Data Conference (IODC)](https://opendatacon.org/), helping
to coordinate a collaborative global open data roadmap. He co-edited a recent
publication
["The State of Open Data: Histories and Horizons"](https://www.idrc.ca/en/book/state-open-data-histories-and-horizons).

Fernando has extensive international experience as a researcher, consultant, and
lecturer, and holds a PhD from the
[University of Sussex Science Policy Research Unit](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/)
in management of technology and innovation.
