Richard co-founded [CollaborateUp](collaborateup.com) to accelerate
collaboration among the public, private, and civil sectors when they take on
some of the world's biggest problems.

Knowing that multi-factorial problems require multi-sector solutions,
CollaborateUp created a set of lean startup tools collaborators can use to
quickly get on the same page, start collaborating, and manage complex
multi-stakeholder initiatives.

Richard and his CollaborateUp colleagues have dedicated themselves to empowering
individuals at all levels to work together and take action on the complex issues
facing our society. Richard serves on multiple boards and advisory councils,
including the Board of Directors of the Office Depot Foundation and the Board of
Advisors of the Corporate Responsibility Association.

He is an alumnus of the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) and
the [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx), a Senior
Fellow at the
[US Chamber of Commerce Foundation](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/), a
Senior Associate at the
[Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), and an
adjunct professor at the George Washington University where he teaches public
private partnerships.
