There is plenty of room for debate about the role that data plays in today's
world. Whichever your favoured metaphor, it is clear that data will have a
profound impact on the development of societies in the coming years. The
question for us is: how do we make sure that our data future is forged not by
and for the few, but by and for everyone? This must start with participation.

## The promise of data

At the [Open Government Partnership (OGP)](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
[Global Summit held this month in Tbilisi, Georgia](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/events/ogp-global-summit-2018-tbilisi/),
the number of conversations centred on the role of data in promoting better
governance was striking. Whether combating corruption, increasing citizen
engagement or driving budget transparency, data, particularly open data, is a
leading focus of the open government movement.

In the development sector too, there are hopes that more and better data will
offer opportunities to improve decision making, open up meaningful citizen
participation, and raise the bar for service delivery. A recent
[Web Foundation report](https://webfoundation.org/2018/03/data-for-development-whats-next-new-research/)
looks at how agencies working in international development can leverage data to
better meet people's needs.

Perhaps most exciting are the thousands of grassroots data initiatives springing
up across the world, with citizens finding creative ways to access and use data
to improve their lives and their communities. One project I've been involved
with is
[TechMousso](https://webfoundation.org/2016/07/techmousso-big-ideas-use-gender-data-to-improve-equality/),
an initiative in CÃ´te d'Ivoire that brought together data, tech and gender
communities to use public data to develop solutions to local problems around
women's health, safety, education and economic empowerment. Another project,
studied by our [Open Data Lab](http://labs.webfoundation.org/), saw villagers in
West Kalimantan, Indonesia, who, unable to access official government data,
built drones to collect aerial mapping data. They used this data to expose
mining companies that were causing environmental damage and violating land
rights, leading the companies to be held accountable.

## Connectivity is key

I arrived at the OGP Global Summit in Georgia from Russia and left Georgia for
Burkina Faso, all the while tracking commonality. I was in Russia for the FIFA
World Cup and, for the most part, I had Wi-Fi in the trains in Moscow. In
Tbilisi, I had great Internet connection down-valley in the city and up on the
mountain at the funicular, where my meetings were held. Today, I am in Burkina
Faso, where 1GB of data will cost me about 10 USD, which is about 15% of
national minimum salary. What I can say for sure is that all data initiatives
have one thing in common: they require connectivity. Whether through apps,
online portals or raw data downloads, people need to be able to access the
Internet and hardware in order to engage. Simply put, if you are not online, you
are excluded from the data revolution.

How big is this barrier? Later this year, for the first time, we will cross the
50% connectivity threshold. While this 50/50 moment is a significant milestone
and something to celebrate, it is a reminder that while we rush to unleash the
benefits of data, half the world is at risk of being left behind.

Of course, those still offline are not evenly distributed. They are largely
concentrated in countries that would stand to benefit most from the potential of
data to boost development, governance and innovation. While 81% of people living
in developed countries use the Internet,
[according to ITU stats](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2017.pdf),
this figure drops to 41% in developing countries and to a mere 17.5% in least
developed countries. This access gap amplifies existing inequalities, channeling
digital benefits to those already most empowered.

Just developing an Internet infrastructure is not enough. Madagascar was
recently cheered for having
[some of the fastest Internet speeds](https://qz.com/1328407/madagascars-internet-beats-uk-and-france/)
in the world. But with widespread poverty and patchy provision of physical
infrastructure like electricity, just 2.1% of the population is actually online.
Is a gold-plated Internet for the few really something to celebrate?

## The cost to connect

In so many countries, data remains too expensive. In Malawi, for instance,
[1GB costs over 20%](http://a4ai.org/mobile-broadband-pricing-data/) of an
average person's income. In Zimbabwe, it is almost 45%. The
[Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI)](https://a4ai.org/) has set a
["1 for 2" target](http://a4ai.org/1for2-affordability-target/) --1GB of data
for no more than 2% of average monthly income. Until countries hit this target,
most people will remain offline. Some groups are disproportionately affected by
high costs. A
[new Web Foundation report](https://webfoundation.org/research/datawomen/)
looking at why open data is not working for women in Africa, found that in
addition to the usual barriers to using open data, women face a host of
additional economic obstacles, such as low pay and time poverty, preventing them
from accessing the web and digital technologies. We must work to understand the
ways various groups are left out and find ways to ensure they are included, not
further marginalized.

## Data for everyone

For all the promises of open data, civic tech, data for governance, artificial
intelligence and digital empowerment, unless we ensure that everyone is
included, these efforts will fall short. The first step is to get the next 50%
of the world connected to the web as quickly as possible. But connectivity is
only the beginning of the story. We need good quality data that is open and free
to access. We need citizens, policy makers and civil society with the skills to
leverage it. We need thoughtful companies that pay attention to the risks as
well as the opportunities of data and care about their customers' welfare.

## Data for tomorrow

As I tie up my fieldwork in Burkina Faso and begin to focus on Dubai for the
second United Nations World Data Forum, I am tasking myself to bring the
connectivity issue to the table. I have a session on data advances in Africa. We
will be exploring the extent to which the data revolution is playing out in
Africa. I am also particularly interested in the discussions around
citizen-generated data, the implementation and use of data at sub-national
levels, and the capacity challenges of the data ecosystems, especially in
Africa. How can communities collaborate on data for the Sustainable Development
Goals? Are communities able to do so? What will it take? Who will take it? If
data is to be a driving force of the Sustainable Development Goals and of 21st
century life, let us ensure that it works for everyone and we leave no one
behind.
