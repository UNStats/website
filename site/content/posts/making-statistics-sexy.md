We are [ _ I Hate Statistics _ ](https://www.ihatestatistics.com/index.php), two
social entrepreneurs from Amsterdam who like solving problems. We have set
ourselves one goal: teaching even those people who are inclined to think they _
hate _ statistics how to understand the world through data. On January 16, we'll
be[ sharing our experiences](//undataforum.org/WorldDataForum/sessions/collective-curriculum-to-make-civil-society-data-literate/)
and vision on how to help everyone learn to love data and statistics.

## Sharing data is not enough

One of the organisations that has greatly inspired us in our goal and has paved
our way to join the United Nations World Data Forum in Cape Town this year is
the Swedish fact tank[ Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/). The global data
heroes from Sweden are doing an amazing job when it comes down to freeing the
world from widespread misconceptions by introducing everyone who's willing to
listen to the right data. However, showing the right graphs is not always
enough. If people do not possess the skills to critically interpret those
beautifully presented data, those data might lead to even more misconceptions.
In our rapidly digitalizing society people are faced with torrents of data every
day. Hence, the need for everyone to possess basic data skills is more important
than ever. And this is exactly where we can be of help. We figured that
alongside teaching statistics to students we'd start at the core of public life:
journalists.

## Fighting data ignorance

Because who knows better how to reach the average news consumer than
journalists? So we started talking to journalists to find out how they thought
they might improve their work. 'I would strongly recommend you to start with
journalists,'--Belgian data
journalist[ Maarten Lambrechts](http://www.maartenlambrechts.com/made.html) told
us.

Many journalists said the same thing: _ 'we do not have the time and skills to
understand and interpret data'. _ And that's a shame, since journalists are
fundamental in informing audiences worldwide about global challenges
demonstrated in the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals. Fighting data
ignorance also means fighting for sustainable development: economic, social and
environmental. But what if journalists get the data wrong, because they simply
do not have the time to dig in or haven't been taught statistics during their
journalism studies?

## Success story disputed

A good example of how a lack of data skills can go viral is
the[ belief that vaccines cause autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy).
Vaccines are an absolute success story of public health
([freeing a large part of the world of polio, measles and diphtheria](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination/)).
Yet due to a lack of critical interpretation of data, a lot of people now
believe that vaccines _ cause _ autism.

For now let's assume
that[ this particular graph](https://www.safeminds.org/mercury-autism/vaccines-and-autism/correlation-between-increases-in-autism-prevalence-and-introduction-of-new-vaccines/)
is correct (no data source mentioned, always something to be suspicious about).
What is correct is
that[ autism prevalence has been rising in the United States](https://spectrumnews.org/news/u-s-stats-show-autism-rate-reaching-possible-plateau/):
it has doubled over the past decade. Judging by these numbers, vaccines and
autism _ are _ _ correlated. _

But this is where one of the essential data literacy skills comes in:
**correlation is not the same as causation**. In simpler terms: **although the
numbers are both going up, it does not mean that vaccines are causing autism**.
Notable (and fun) examples that correlations do not equal causations can be
found on the
website[ spuriouscorrelations.com](http://www.spuriouscorrelations.com/) The
only way to actually prove causation is by performing randomized control trials.
So a decade ago, scientists decided to use these experiments to closely study
the relation between vaccines and autism. By designing scientific experiments
where people were not vaccinated or were vaccinated at fewer intervals and
comparing this to the regular schedule, one can find out whether vaccines are
causing
autism.[ As can be read in these papers, they concluded that vaccines do not cause autism](http://autismsciencefoundation.org/what-is-autism/autism-and-vaccines/).
This example illustrates an important lesson for using data to update and refine
your beliefs: ** interpretation is everything**. And people need basic data
literacy skills to draw the right conclusions and to understand interpretations
made by others.

## Passionate to help

As it is our mission to help everyone interpret data, we're passionate to help
people learn these skills. But which concepts do we expect everyone to master?
What are the basic data literacy skills that are required to interpret the data
concerning the sustainable development goals correctly? First of all, what we
need is a curriculum: a list of the most important skills. That is exactly why
we
are[ organizing a workshop](//undataforum.org/WorldDataForum/sessions/collective-curriculum-to-make-civil-society-data-literate/)
during the United Nations World Data Forum. **On January 16 at 3:15 pm we'll be
presenting our Collective curriculum to make civil society data literate in
meeting room 2.61.**

Firstly, we will create this particular list together with the attending
participants (you?). Secondly, we will record the most successful explanations
of participants on how to teach these concepts to people who (still) think they
hate statistics. Of course, we will also share our experiences with teaching
students statistics and share our vision on how we can help civil society become
more data literate.

At the end of the conference, we will return to our tiny country below sea level
with a free, crowd-sourced curriculum and corresponding teaching material that
we will make available for everyone on this planet who wants to learn or teach
basic data literacy skills!

** Which data and statistics concepts/skills do you consider essential for every
civilian and journalist? Do you have experiences helping people learn these
skills? **
