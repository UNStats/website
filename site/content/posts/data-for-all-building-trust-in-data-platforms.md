The world is going through an unparalleled transition affecting the way
communities live and work together. Urbanization, poverty, inequality, scarce
natural resources, gender, health, edducation, and climate. The issues are not
new, but a challenge faced by many communities remains: How to put quality data
in the hands of policymakers at the right time and in the right format to
improve planning and decision making?

The 2018 United Nations World Data Forum will bring together communities of data
producers and data users from around the globe, all searching for pragmatic
solutions to the many data challenges facing the global community. It will be an
important opportunity to learn about how sustainable development can thrive on
data-driven strategies.

Building trust in data can help communities rethink their own development
strategies. In 2013, the Secretary-General's High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons
on the Post-2015 Development Agenda
[wrote in their report](http://www.post2015hlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/UN-Report.pdf):
"Better data and statistics will help governments track progress and make sure
their decisions are evidence-based; they can also strengthen accountability.
This is not just about governments. International agencies, CSOs [civil society
organizations] and the private sector should be involved. A true data revolution
would draw on existing and new sources of data to fully integrate statistics
into decision making, promote open access to, and use of, data and ensure
increased support for statistical systems." Thematic area 5 of the United
Nations World Data Forum will explore options for National Statistical Offices
(NSOs) and civil society organizations to pragmatically embrace open data
principles and adopt data standards, in tandem with technology, that promote
multi-stakeholder partnerships for data producers and users.

Expectations are high for the data revolution to respond to the demands for
complex development issues to be addressed with better data production and use.
There is hope that rapidly emerging information technologies will promote
transparency and accountability. Wide-ranging debates about the use of new
information technologies for sustainable development are ongoing. At one
extreme, techno-enthusiasts hold a giddy, utopian perspective that technology
will "fix" everything. And, at the other extreme, statisticians have a more
conservative view of how existing systems may adapt to technological change,
more slowly, one step at a time. The challenge is to find a sustainable middle
ground between these two extremes and to move ahead with data-driven strategies
that are appropriate and effective. NSOs are further mandated by the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development to translate the commitment of "ensuring that no one
is left behind" into concrete and practical tools for
[Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs)
monitoring that fit into the broader context of national development priorities.
This implies breaking from the business-as-usual approaches by harnessing
emerging information technology with innovations that transform the capabilities
of government entities to address the demands of the 2030 Agenda.

There is a need to mobilize stakeholders to participate in the 2018 United
Nations World Data Forum to address shared concerns on capacity gaps in data and
analytics. In this way, we will better understand the world around us through
data, disaggregated by characteristics such as age, sex, residence, income, and
disability at the national and sub-national levels. Based on the achievements
and lessons learned from monitoring the Millennium Development Goals, NSOs have
stressed the need for national SDG indicator reporting and dissemination
platforms to improve access to data on key national development priorities and
the transparency of official statistics, in compliance with the
[Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx).
In response to this need, the
[United Nations Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/home/) consulted
with stakeholders to recommend
[principles and guidelines for national platforms for SDG reporting](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/BG-Item3a-NRDP-E.pdf).

The next step is to establish a United Nations technical function to help review
and assess national reporting platforms. This function should provide
coordination, coherence, and perhaps incubation, in order to compare solutions
in an unbiased manner and to help NSOs make informed choices about the most
suitable solutions in their own contexts. The United Nations World Data Forum
will provide an opportunity to take this forward, specifically during the
sessions under thematic area 5 on:

- Community data collaborations to achieve the SDGs;
- Building together for benefits to all;
- Multi-stakeholder data collaborations for sustainable development in Africa.

And under thematic area 6, "How far have we come?", the United Nations World
Data Forum will help identify emerging opportunities for NSOs to exchange ideas
in sessions on:

- The role of NSOs in enhancing capacity development of national statistical
  systems;
- Modernisation of national statistics;
- Developing capacities for the 2030 Agenda;
- Achieving an efficient United Nations statistical system.

In the context of these discussions,
[Community Systems Foundation (CSF)](https://www.communitysystemsfoundation.org/)
will showcase the [Data For All (DFA) toolkit](http://dataforall.org/). The DFA
toolkit is a platform of open source software tools designed to help NSOs
produce reliable and timely data for programme planning, service delivery,
transparency, and accountability. DFA toolkit is contributing to the SDGs and
the 2030 Agenda by assisting Member States of the United Nations in
strengthening data and statistical systems for evidence-based policy
formulation.

The DFA toolkit promotes greater interoperability within the ecosystem of
socioeconomic statistics. Its approach complies with the
[Common Statistical Production Architecture](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/CSPA/Common+Statistical+Production+Architecture),
which is a set of common principles, standards and guidelines designed to
promote greater interoperability among the different stakeholders that make up
the ecosystem of official statistics.

The DFA toolkit provides a leading-edge information technology platform to
leverage the role of the national statistical systems to support the overall
normative and analytical work required for successful monitoring of the SDGs by
Member States of the United Nations. It promotes compliance with international
statistical standards endorsed by the United Nations Statistical Commission.

The DFA toolkit broadens the scope of data sources for effective SDG monitoring.
It uses traditional data sources, strengthened by administrative management
information systems. The toolkit also helps advance the use of new, innovative
data sources, such as geospatial data and, where relevant, crowdsourcing, mobile
phone data collection, smart devices, big data, and SMS polling.

The DFA toolkit method for development embraces a collaborative strategy using
the DFA open source software toolkit. Under this software development
methodology, the source code is made available under open source license to
analyze, change and improve its design over time. This strategy provides an
efficient model for Member States and a community of users to share the costs
and the benefits of the system.
