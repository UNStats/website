As we prepare for the United Nations World Data Forum in January, it will have
been over three years since the
[Secretary-General's High-Level Panel of eminent persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda](https://www.un.org/sg/en/management/beyond2015.shtml)
called for a
["data revolution for sustainable development, with a new international initiative to improve the quality of statistics and information available to citizens."](https://www.un.org/sg/sites/www.un.org.sg/files/files/HLP_P2015_Report.pdf)
At [Development Initiatives](http://devinit.org/), where we have been promoting
the value of data since 1993, it was music to our ears. The importance of data
is now firmly grounded in the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, and leaving no-one behind is at its heart. Crucially, these new
goals and commitments require a different mindset and different tools to measure
and monitor progress.

While existing statistics help us track national averages, they do not focus
enough on who is included in progress and who is left behind. For data to be fit
for purpose, we need to know exactly who the poorest people are and whether they
are part of global progress. For this, global and local communities will need to
harness the power of the data revolution and ensure that progress is monitored
by accurately counting individual people everywhere.

Part of Development Initiatives' efforts on this is our new
[P20 Initiative](http://devinit.org/p20i/). The P20 Initiative will track
progress based on key data for the poorest 20% of people globally, promoting the
use of data disaggregated by income quintile, geography, gender, age and
disability. In any country, if the status of this group fails to improve, then
the success of the 2030 Agenda will be out of reach.

Our
[consultation paper](http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-initiative-data-to-leave-no-one-behind),
just launched, uses the best data available to establish who the people in the
P20 are, where they live, and what we can say about their status as a group
across three key bellwether indicators, namely: income, nutrition and civil
registration. The question that underpins our work is: are the poorest 20% of
people getting their share of global progress, or are they being left behind? We
want to know if people in the P20 are better off, better nourished and being
counted by their governments.

## Why these bellwether indicators?

- Rising _incomes_ give people choice and control over the goods and services
  they need, whether to invest in a home or a livelihood, in food, health,
  education or information.
- Better _nutrition_ underpins health, as well as the ability to learn and earn.
- _Civil registration_ means people count and have rights. We cannot begin to
  track if every individual has access to basic health, education or economic
  growth if we do not know they exist.

## What do we know so far?

The gap between the poorest 20% of people and everyone else is getting bigger
(source: Development Initiatives based on
[PovcalNet](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/introduction.aspx)):

- Currently the P20 receive less than 1% of the world's income. They will need
  to share in a greater proportion of global growth if they are not to be left
  behind.
- The P20 account for 44% of all under-5 cases of stunting.
- More than half of all unregistered births are in the P20.
- The P20 are spread across over 100 countries, although around three quarters
  live in just nine countries.

The data we already have goes some way to helping us build a profile of those
who fall into this category. People in the P20 are more likely to be casual
labourers than to have a secure job and are more likely to work in hazardous
environments and often on exploitative terms. They are more likely to be living
in conflict-affected places, remote rural areas and urban slums. As families,
they have very few assets, so an illness, the loss of work, a mudslide or a
drought can push people and their loved ones into deeper poverty. The P20 are
also likely to be held back by discrimination which reinforces disadvantage this
may be because of aspects of their identity such as gender, religion, caste,
sexual orientation, disability, age or citizenship status.

This profile of the P20 is built on the best available data, but it is only a
starting point. Progress on reducing poverty globally and inequalities across
countries can only be measured with disaggregated data and ensuring everyone is
counted. At its most basic, data should be disaggregated by income quintile,
geography, gender, age and disability (QGGAD). This requires going beyond the
household level and counting each and every person. The current data landscape
does not provide sufficient data in all locations about people and the services
they have access to. For example, poverty data relies on survey data but surveys
often miss out key groups such as the homeless, refugees and other marginalized
groups in society. We must invest in and improve civil registration and vital
statistics, as well as ensure more censuses occur so that everyone is counted.

The urgency of making progress means that we should utilize the data that does
exist despite its shortcomings. However, to achieve a radical poverty
eradication agenda, we must also urgently invest in better, disaggregated data
and statistics.
