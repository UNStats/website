To meet the objectives set forth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
it is clear, we need not only new solutions, but also
[new methods for arriving at solutions](https://www.opendemocracy.net/stefaan-g-verhulst/from-resistance-to-reimagining-governance-6-shifts-that-can-improve-way-we-solve-).
Towards that end
[statistical agencies](http://thegovlab.org/access-to-new-data-sources-for-statistics-business-models-and-incentives-for-the-corporate-sector/),
for example, are increasingly looking to non-traditional data sources from the
private and civil sectors to complement and enhance official statistics. The
vast streams of data generated through technology, social media platforms and
other sensors, when analyzed responsibly, can offer unique insights into
societal patterns and behaviors.

These insights could be harnessed to enable innovative ways to measure global
progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and inform evidence-based
policy decisions. At the same time, large datasets create their own problems of
complexity and noise, risks to privacy and security, and the potential to have a
disparate impact on already vulnerable populations.

One of the greatest tasks of our era may be figuring out how to unlock and
harness the value of this data to provide actionable insights for positive
social and economic impacts. This is where the role of
[data collaboratives](http://datacollaboratives.org/) comes in.
[Data collaboratives](http://datacollaboratives.org/social-media.html) refer to
an emergent form of public-private partnership that allows for collaboration
around new data sources across sectors, SDGs and geographies.

Data collaborative-type entities and initiatives have emerged in sectors as
varied as
[agriculture](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/intels-big-data-for-precision-farming.html),
[climate change mitigation](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/mapping-snow-melting-in-the-sierra-nevada.html),
[gender](http://www.data2x.org/big-data-challenge-awards/) and
[health](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/kaiser-permanente-research-bank.html),
among many others.
[In Estonia](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/mobile-positioning-for-tourism-statistics.html),
anonymized mobile phone data is helping to understand the volume of tourism and
foreign workers, and to tailor government services and transport options to them
accordingly.
[In Namibia](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/tracking-malaria-in-namibia-with-cell-phone-data.html),
satellite imagery and telecom businesses are sharing data to track the spread of
malaria. If you are interested in learning about other examples of these data
collaboratives and initiatives, please click

Yet, for all its promise, the practice of data collaboratives remains largely ad
hoc and limited. In part, this is the result of a lack of a well-defined,
professionalized concept of data stewardship within corporations that includes a
clear mandate to explore ways to harness the potential of their data towards
positive public ends. Consequentially, the process of establishing data
collaboratives and leveraging privately held data for policy making is onerous
and prone to dissolution when the internal champions involved move on to other
functions. By establishing data stewardship as a corporate function, recognized
and trusted within corporations, and by creating the methods and tools needed
for responsible data-sharing, the practice of data collaboratives can become
regularized and less risky.

## DataStewards.net

With support from the
[Hewlett Foundation](https://www.hewlett.org/strategy/citizen-voices-and-evidence-informed-policy/),
[the GovLab](http://thegovlab.org/) has embarked on a project,
[DataStewards.net](https://datastewards.net/), to identify and connect existing
practices of data stewardship and to define new approaches to data
responsibility.

At a kick-off event held at the Cloudera Foundation in May 2018 -- attended by
representatives from Linkedin, Facebook, Uber, Mastercard, DigitalGlobe,
Cognizant and Streetlight Data, among others -- participants described their
experiences with data collaboration, mapped key opportunities and challenges,
and discussed the roles and responsibilities of "data stewards" groups or
individuals within corporations responsible for the handling of data.

Four key takeaways emerged that help us to better understand both the potential
and challenges of data collaboratives. These are summarized briefly below
([longer version here](https://medium.com/@sverhulst/data-stewards-data-leadership-to-address-21st-century-challenges-3e956ecd7891)).

1. **Maturity and capacity:** Attendees pointed out that the field of data
   collaboratives is fledgling and ill-defined, posing certain challenges to
   more widespread adoption. In particular, public awareness is limited, leading
   to ambivalence or suspicion. Corporations themselves often don't appreciate
   the value of sharing data, which similarly limits the amount of private data
   shared for the public good. There often exists confusion on how to pursue
   public good in the context of a profit-driven business. Additionally,
   attendees pointed out that holders and recipients of data often lack the
   resources to use and maximize the potential of shared information. Increasing
   human and technical capacity--along with awareness-- is therefore critical to
   expanding the use of data collaboratives.

2. **Transaction costs:** Conference participants also pointed to the high
   transaction costs of data sharing. These can come from preparing data;
   identifying and vetting potential partners; and negotiating the legal and
   commercial terms of sharing. Importantly, transaction costs are especially
   burdensome for entities that are under-funded or under-resourced. Mitigating
   these transaction costs is essential to creating a broader community of data
   collaboratives and to ensuring a level playing field.

3. **Scaling:** It is often difficult to scale or replicate data collaboratives.
   What works in one instance is frequently less successful in another. A
   small-scale sharing project may have trouble including new and more data. To
   overcome these challenges, participants suggested platforms to help groups
   find new opportunities or identify new collaboration partners. Pooling of
   efforts, expertise and experience is essential, especially for groups that
   lack resources.

4. **Community of practice:** There was broad consensus on the need for a
   community in which data stewards can share experiences and resources. Such an
   environment, formal or informal, would offer a safe environment for
   practitioners to trade stories, tools and lessons. Even MOUs, contract
   language and legal frameworks, as well as a mapping of firms pioneering data
   uses for public good, could be shared through the community of practice.

The _United Nations World Data Forum_ provides a great opportunity to review,
validate and find ways to make data collaboratives more systemic and
sustainable. I hope you will join us at our panel on "data stewardship in
action" that will look into options towards reducing barriers and unlocking
beneficial partnerships between the private and the public sectors to return
value to the population, directly improving quality of life. In the meantime, if
anyone is interested in joining the emerging data stewards community of
practice, please get in touch with us through
