The 2018 United Nations World Data Forum promises to be an exciting event,
bringing together communities of data users and data producers, researchers, and
policy makers. It is a unique United Nations led undertaking. Over three days,
from 22â€“24 October, we will all be "data people" and regarded as equals, no
matter our organizational affiliation. We will all have a voice and an
opportunity to share our expertise and vision for a better world served by
better data.

Like the first United Nations World Data Forum, the 2018 United Nations World
Data Forum is organized around themes. Theme 5 is building trust in data and
statistics. This topic is very important and of particular interest and
relevance today as the specter of "fake news" and "alternative facts" looms
around us. More than ever, we need to build trust in data throughout the data
value chain, from production and analysis to dissemination and use, data is
impacting decisions that affect the lives of all people. The United Nations
World Data Forum will be a great occasion to discuss what it takes to achieve
this goal.

So what do we need to discuss at the United Nations World Data Forum in October?
Let's start by thinking about what the data ecosystem of 2030 could look like,
what we want to achieve, but also what we want to avoid, and use that as a guide
to identify the issues we need to address.

## What do we want for a 2030 data ecosystem?

- **Hope to achieve:** A world where data are part of the DNA and culture of
  decision-making, used by all and valued as an important public good. A world
  where citizens trust the systems that produce data and have the skills and
  means to use and verify their quality and accuracy. A world where there are
  safeguards in place to protect privacy, while bringing the benefits of open
  data to all. In this world, countries value their national statistical
  systems, which are working independently with trusted partners in the public
  and private sectors and citizens to continuously meet the changing and
  expanding demands from data users and policy makers. Private sector data
  generators are generously sharing their data with the public sector. And gaps
  in data are closing, making the dream of leaving no one behind come true, with
  the
  [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) on
  the path to being met by 2030.

- **Hope to avoid:** A world where large corporations control the bulk of
  national and international data and statistics with only limited sharing with
  the public sector, academics, and citizens. The culture of "every man for
  himself" and "who pays, wins" dominates data sharing practices. National
  statistical systems are under-resourced and under-valued, with low trust from
  users, further weakening them and undermining their independence from
  political interference and their ability to control quality. The divide
  between those who have and those who do not have access, skills, and the
  ability to use data for decision-making and policy has widened. Data systems
  and their promise to count the uncounted and leave no one behind are falling
  behind due to low capacity and poor standards and institutions, and the hope
  of the 2030 agenda is fading.

With this vision in mind, are we on the right path? An optimist would say we are
closer to the data ecosystem that we want to achieve. However, there are also
some examples of movement in the wrong direction. There is no magic wand to make
our wish come true, but a powerful enabler would be building trust in data and
statistics. Therefore, this should be included as a goal in all our data
strategies and action plans. Here are some important building blocks underlying
trust in data and statistics:

1. Building strong organizational infrastructure, governance, and partnerships;
1. Following sound data standards and principles for production, sharing,
   interoperability, and dissemination; and
1. Addressing the last mile in the data value chain to meet users' needs, create
   value with data, and ensure meaningful impacts.

I encourage all our expert colleagues and partners to propose relevant and
vibrant sessions for theme 5 of this year's United Nations World Forum and share
their expertise widely. At the previous United Nations World Forum, we had
twelve sessions on
[open data](http://opendatawatch.com/blog/breakthroughs-for-open-data-at-un-world-data-forum/),
data interoperability, data standards, and principles, which launched many
important initiatives. As we take stock of our progress and make ambitious plans
for the future, we must keep in the mind the responsibility we all share to
demonstrate that we work in the public interest and that the public's trust in
data and statistics is justified. Trust is not easy to achieve or maintain, but
it is easy to lose. The path to the data ecosystem we want for 2030, is a path
that leads to trust in this ecosystem.
