Persons with disabilities have long known what it's like to be hidden from the
world. Historically, persons with disabilities faced barriers, marginalization
and were not counted. Even those who have been active in their communities still
have the barriers they face and their experience of disability ignored,
misunderstood or dismissed. Disability has too long been regarded as a medical
problem.

If our overarching goal for 2030 is for global sustainable development to leave
no one behind, then we must count everyone and we must also count who they are.
As governments, UN agencies and civil society gather in Cape Town for the
_United Nations World Data Forum_ to improve how we measure development progress
and sustainability, it is not enough to ensure accurate tallies of populations.

We agreed long ago in development that age and gender matter, and we recognize
this by disaggregating population data in these ways, and observing
discrepancies to orient or reorient development efforts.

The United Nations World Data Forum is an opportunity to consolidate this common
commitment to the SDGs. All national statistics offices, the United Nations,
civil society and organizations of persons with disabilities must collaborate so
that we can collect powerful datasets that include all persons with
disabilities, and that we can disaggregate this population data by disability
status. As Chairs of the
[International Disability Alliance](http://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/)
and the
[International Disability and Development Consortium](https://www.iddcconsortium.net/),
we are committed to working with all stakeholders to ensure this happens.

Persons with disabilities are members of all societies and communities across
the world. The SDGs themselves, and their specific indicators, clearly state
that disaggregated data are needed and should be collected to monitor
advancement in the implementation of the goals. Only then can we ensure
meaningful and useful international comparability over time.

Tools already exist, including the Washington Group short set of questions and,
for disaggregation by disability among children, the
[UNICEF/Washington Group module on Child Functioning](https://data.unicef.org/resources/module-child-functioning/).
The World Health Organization has also developed the
[Model Disability Survey](https://www.who.int/disabilities/data/mds/en/) and
other UN agencies are in the process of developing new modules. We have found
these tools can be easily and cost effectively streamlined into all national
data collection efforts. Further data and information can also be harnessed to
guide policy makers on achieving the SDGs and measure the tangible impacts of
policies and programmes across populations.

The 2030 Agenda calls on all of us to work in partnership to achieve its Goals.
Since the 2030 Agenda's adoption, this is the first major test of our
commitment&mdash;across governments, UN Agencies, civil society and
beyond&mdash;to build real working partnerships towards this shared vision. The
world has agreed that sustainable development means inclusive development.
Persons with disabilities are here in South Africa to make sure we're counted.
