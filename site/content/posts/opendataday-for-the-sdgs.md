Two people go searching for a partner online. They come across each other's
profiles. Though they come from very different backgrounds, their profiles line
up with shared interests and shared values. After some back and forth by email
and instant message, they agree to meet at a Waffle House. Who are they? One
represents an NGO helping small farmers recover from a recent disaster. The
other is a supply chain management executive for a multinational agribusiness
company looking to rebuild their supply chain while opening up new markets and
suppliers in the wake of the disaster.

Why did they meet at a Waffle House? Because they both know that Waffle Houses
are used by the [US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](fema.gov) as a
proxy for tracking disasters. If the Waffle House is closed, things are really
bad. Where did they find each other? On the Shared Value Index &ndash; a new
platform scoped out by a team of data scientists during "Open Data Day San
Francisco: Using Open Data to Solve the SDGs".

Organized by the Open Data Bay Area meetup and sponsored and hosted by
[Domino Data Lab](https://www.dominodatalab.com/), this mini-hackathon brought
together data scientists, engineers and civil society pros to hack on using open
data to tackle the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The
event was held in the spirit of the _United Nations World Data Forum_, which
will convene its next session in Dubai in October 2018.

## Independent Expert and Advisory Group

A 2014 report from the UN Secretary-General's Independent Expert and Advisory
Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development, entitled
"[A World That Counts](https://www.undatarevolution.org/)", outlines a set of
key recommendations for how to tap into the data revolution and advance the
SDGs.

Among its recommendations: convene the _United Nations World Data Forum_ and
build a platform of trust and confidence among key stakeholders and data users
through shared principles and shared technology and innovations for the common
good. The participants in this mini-hackathon convened in service of those very
principles.

After hearing brief "lightning talks" from experts on different parts of the
SDGs, participants received a crash course in the
[Domino Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) Marketplace](https://www.dominodatalab.com/domino-for-good/data-science-social-good-marketplace/),
an open platform where they can share their ideas and data sets.

They also got a crash course in the
[CollaborateUp Formula](https://collaborateup.com/), a lean startup approach to
social innovation and creating shared value. Participants brainstormed barriers
to using open data for the SDGs that included disconnects among data collectors,
data providers and data users, and data that doesn't tell the whole story. They
then brainstormed issues they'd like to work on, ultimately deciding to pick one
global issue and one hyper-local issue to hack on:

- Mapping and matchmaking for SDG-related partners
- Providing free Internet access for children outside of school in Oakland

## CollaborateUp Formula Working group

Breaking into teams and using the CollaborateUp Formula, each team had an
afternoon to scope their problem, identify data sets and develop a "pitch" to
share with the group. The mapping and matchmaking group came up with the story
that opened this blog and a set of six data axes that need mapping:

- **SDGs:** down to the sub-SDG
- **Organizations:** that have made public statements related to the SDGs
- **Geography:** where the work/commitment is occurring
- **Time:** when the work happened or will occur
- **Access:** similar to the Waffle House Index, develop an international proxy
  to indicate the ease of working in a given area
- **Funding:** where's the money committed and by whom?
- **Rating of social impact:** how effective has the work been?

The group working on free internet access in Oakland identified a potential
partner NGO and data sets to determine areas with high need concentrations. Both
groups decided to create a space on the Domino DSSG Marketplace and continue
hacking on these problems. They also identified several takeaways and
suggestions for others interested in using open data for the SDGs:

- It's difficult to find open data.
- We have to be really careful about how we interpret the data. As an example,
  don't assume that kids live near the school they attend or that broadband
  availability equates to accessibility. Children in Oakland are often bussed to
  schools from far away, and while an internet service provider map might
  indicate availability in a given ZIP code, the families in that ZIP code may
  not be able to afford it.
- There are many people already working on related initiatives &ndash; hence the
  value of the SDG matchmaking idea.
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) created a markup that agencies could use to
  indicate that they were posting open data about the agency's work. This made
  it easier for others to scrape and aggregate that data. The United Nations or
  the
  [Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data](http://www.data4sdgs.org/)
  could do something similar to make it easier for organizations to share their
  commitments and for others to find them.

**How you can get involved**

This is just a quick summary of the ideas that came out of the hackathon. We
hope to share more details as they develop. If you have any suggestions, please
share them in the comments or email us at
[info@collaboratup.com](mailto:info@collaboratup.com).

From this experience we can see how open data can accelerate the SDGs.
Unfortunately, many of the data we need remain trapped. As individuals and
organizations across the world redefine sustainability and begin purposeful
projects to meet the SDGs, we urgently need to mobilize the data revolution
through collaborative action. If you feel drawn to one of the projects scoped
out during the Open Data SF hackathon, consider joining the
[Domino DSSG Marketplace](https://www.dominodatalab.com/domino-for-good/data-science-social-good-marketplace/)
to start hacking! As another option, iTech recently established its
"[SDGs data lab](http://www.sdgdatalabs.org/data/)" to provide assistance in
design, development and production of national SDG dashboards and reports.
Either platform would provide a good starting place.

Finally, join us at the _United Nations World Data Forum_ in Dubai, United Arab
Emirates, on October 22-24, 2018, where we will continue to work together to
accelerate our collective impact.
