We measure what we value and value what we measure. This is a core tenet of data
collection. But what does it mean for women and girls? When we
[fail to measure critical dimensions of women's and girls' lives](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00899.x),
everything, from their economic contributions to their degrees of access to
vital services, we undervalue their roles and experiences in society, entrench
biases, and ultimately, leave women and girls behind.

[Data2X](https://data2x.org/) is a civil society initiative working with
governments, specialized agencies of the United Nations system, statisticians,
researchers, and civil society to improve gender data production and use. We
work to ensure that women and girls are represented, valued, and counted through
quality, accessible, timely data, and that these data translate into sound
policy. We see the United Nations World Data Forum as an opportunity to broaden
the conversation and ensure that gender data is recognized as central to
achieving our ambitions of improved data for development.

We've seen firsthand the resurgence of enthusiasm and action in the gender data
field, from substantial
[financial and programmatic commitments](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2016/05/Gates-Foundation-Announces-80-Mill-Doll-Comm-Closing-Gender-Data-Gaps-Acc-Progress-for-Women-Girls)
for gender initiatives to a greater media focus on the
[urgency of good data](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/09/22/495051955/theres-a-glaring-gap-in-the-war-against-poverty-and-disease)
production in global development. Now, we need to all work together to harness
this momentum and prioritize gender data as a key tool in achieving gender
equality as promised by the
[Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs).

As we work towards achieving the SDGs over the next 14 years, we need the
ability to track advancements, course correct, measure success, and share
results to drive action and investment and gender data can be a speedometer on
our progress. We need to match the boldness of the SDGs with timely, open and
inclusive data to support our collective mission of improving outcomes for women
and girls.

Gender data goes beyond realizing
[Goal 5](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg5). An intersectional gender
and human rights lens is integral to the success of other SDGs, from quality
education to decent work and economic growth to the ideals of peace, justice and
strong institutions. We cannot comprehensively track SDG progress or inform
critical policy without sex-disaggregated data to reveal the unique impacts of
policies and programs on girls' and women's lives.

The good news is that we can start this work now. Data2X and
[Open Data Watch](https://opendatawatch.com/) have identified 16 global
indicators across eight SDGs which are
[ready to measure](https://data2x.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ready-to-Measure.pdf)
outcomes for women and girls. These indicators have internationally agreed
definitions and comparatively wide coverage, are produced through available data
collection instruments, and do not have built-in gender biases. All offer the
opportunity to "jump start" data collection at a low cost in a majority of
countries.

But, as we know, working with data is not an overnight process. Realizing the
meaningful change we envision through the SDGs requires sustained, long-term
commitment, and continued focus in settings like the United Nations World Data
Forum.

Progress in gender data must build upon the field's lengthy history which has
been driven forward by committed United Nations agencies, countries, civil
society, and researchers around the world. We must harness renewed energy and
robust multi-sector support to reinforce and strengthen our gender data
movement. In this vein, we are asking the data community to support four calls
to action:

1. We need to support the work of existing data collectors and producers around
   the world and support growth of the next generation to disaggregate data by
   sex, to ask the right questions which generate data without gender bias, and
   to know how to analyze and translate their results.

1. We need to support a cadre of policymakers who are dedicated to investing in
   data collection and making decisions informed by evidence. The majority of
   governments want to use accurate data about women today and always to guide
   their policy making decisions; however, they need more technical and
   financial support to develop the capacity, and we need to continue to make
   the case for why gender data is important.

1. We need to understand more about what private sector sources of data can tell
   us about women's and girls' lives and contributions, and how we can better
   partner with the private sector on this work.

1. We need civil society, advocates, journalists, and communities to call for
   gender data, translate and track that data, and use that data to hold
   decision-makers accountable for change.

It is critical that we maintain this global groundswell of excitement for and
engagement in gender data. If we do not improve our ability to measure the
change between the reality for women and girls today and their reality 14 years
from now, we will not have done our job to fulfill the mandates of the SDGs. At
the United Nations World Data Forum, let's think big so that we can act boldly
to accomplish the work that lies ahead.
