The smartphone has changed our world as we know it,
[with 79 percent of people between 18 and 44 having their devices within reach 22 hours a day](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/smartphones/480485).
This new extension of our hands has become a "digital echo" of our real
behaviour, with thousands of mobile applications accelerating our data
generation and providing a wide range of companies with a scary amount of data
on who we are, where we go, what we do and why we do it. In the era of "Big
Data", an innocent online search for some golf clubs turns into a commercial
pursuit to convert interest into investment--which has started to cause some
alarm amongst consumers.

Over the past few years, an increasing number of questions around privacy and
the value of our data have come to the forefront of political debate. Cyber
attack headlines and aggressive advertising in the top of our minds have led
people to become more aware about the negative use of their data, often
neglecting the many positive ways in which data is being used around the world.
The mainstream media tends to focus on the Internet giants of this world and how
they exploit data. However, telecommunications companies also have access to
incredibly insightful data sets. The telcos of this world are increasingly
finding ways to have a social impact with the data created by their customers,
[who spend an average of 145 minutes per day tapping and swiping away](https://blog.dscout.com/mobile-touches).
Of course, mobile behaviour varies immensely in different geographies, and the
extent of this social impact depends on how developed the country of analysis
is. For this reason, projects on Big Data for Social Good based on mobile data
have
[tended to focus on developing countries](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/trade/events/2015/abudhabi/presentations/day3/02/2b%20A-Using%20Big%20Data%20for%20the%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals%2010222015.pdf),
targeting the alarming problems linked to Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2
--"No Poverty" and "Zero Hunger". With the _United Nations World Data Forum_
taking place in Cape Town from 15-18 January, 2017, we decided to take a look at
7 projects, linked to 7 different Sustainable Development Goals to underline
just how far mobile data can go in monitoring the progress we make on the
world's biggest challenges:

## Goal 1: No Poverty

### Poverty Analysis in Senegal (Orange and the State University of New York at Buffalo USA).

[By using mobile phone usage data and regional level mobility information,](http://d4d.orange.com/content/download/43330/405662/version/3/file/D4Dchallenge_leaflet_A4_V2Eweblite.pdf)
Orange and the State University of New York are creating poverty maps showcasing
a wide range of perspectives which can be provide decision makers with better
insights to eradicate poverty in the most efficient way possible in Senegal.

## Goal 3: Good health and well-being

### Mobility Data Analysis in Mexico during the H1N1 Flu Outbreak (Movistar)

Scientific experts in the
[Telefónica Research and Development team ](http://www.vanessafriasmartinez.org/uploads/epidemics.pdf)used
their
[Smart Steps technology](https://www.luca-d3.com/business-insights/index.html)
to understand the efficiency of government measures during the H1N1 flu outbreak
of 2009,
[which was estimated to have affected up to 375,000 people](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006895).
Human movement directly accelerates the spread of diseases so they analyzed
mobility patterns before and after the government advised citizens to stay at
home, uncovering that only 30% of people stayed at home, whilst 70% barely
showed any changes in their day to day behaviour. In the future, this
data-driven approach to handling health pandemics will inevitably save lives and
help governments to optimize their response.

## Goal 4: Quality education

### Using mobile data to increase the reach and effectiveness of digital education for the children that most need it (Profuturo, Telef�nica)

[Profuturo ](https://fundacionprofuturo.org/web/general-navigation/aula-digital)
aims to bring digital education to millions of children who currently are
deprived from quality education. The program captures data from every
interaction with the platform for all students and teachers, as well as
contextual data about the country, region, etc. With this mobile data, learning
analytics takes place to predict the success of students, teachers and projects.
The project has started in Angola where the education program is now offered to
8000 children. It is now being extended to other countries in Africa as well as
in Central and South America.

## Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy

### Using Mobile Data for Electrification Planning in Senegal (University of Manchester, Ecole sup�rieure polytechnique de Dakar UCAD and the Santa Fe Institute)

Mobile phone data has proved to be an accurate proxy of
[the energy needs of populations in Senegal](http://d4d.orange.com/content/download/43330/405662/version/3/file/D4Dchallenge_leaflet_A4_V2Eweblite.pdf),
allowing telecommunications operators to help utilities providers build
bottom-up demand models. This is especially important where there is scarce
information on the constantly evolving energy needs of people and companies in
developing countries. In the future, mobile data will be crucial in helping
governments and utilities providers to decide where to invest in renewable
energies � making them more affordable for citizens.

## Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities

### Crime Prediction in the city of London in the UK (02 Telef�nica and the University of Trento)

Academic and mobile data experts used anonymized and aggregated mobile data and
police data to predict crime hotspots in London.
[Identifying them with an accuracy of 70 percent](https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/londons-future-crime-hot-spots-predicted-using-mobile-phone-data-ae869a2e67ab#.wcysd1n5x),
6% higher than when police data was used on its own. The analysis showed that
some components of mobile phone data are more important than others. For
example, the data about the phone's home location showed a strong correlation
with crime patterns. In the future, these insights could be invaluable to law
enforcement authorities in making our cities safer.

## Goal 13: Climate action

### Using Mobile Data to measure CO2 emissions in Nuremberg, Germany (O2 Telef�nica, Teralytics and the South Pole Group)

Local governments are facing immense challenges with accelerating rates of CO2
emissions causing serious air pollution problems in cities. The first and most
important step to combat this is to collect accurate data to identify where the
major air pollution hotspots are, ahead of investing in solutions such as
improved public transport or new infrastructure.
[In Nuremberg, local government decision makers are working with O2](http://data-speaks.luca-d3.com/2016/11/can-mobile-data-combat-climate-change.html),
Teralytics and the South Pole Group to understand mobility patterns using mobile
data, extracting insights on traffic which allow them to make predictions on
pollution in a more cost-efficient way than surveys or sensors.

## Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals

### The Open Algorithms Project

In order to overcome
[the challenges](http://data-speaks.luca-d3.com/2016/10/the-6-challenges-of-big-data-for-social.html)
facing private sector organizations wanting to use their Big Data for Social
Good, [the Data-Pop Alliance](http://datapopalliance.org/),
[Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/),
[Orange Group](http://www.orange.com/en/home), the
[World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/) and
[Telef�nica ](https://www.telefonica.com/es)have come together in the
[Open Algorithms Project](http://www.opalproject.org/collaborators/). OPAL will
consist in an open platform and algorithms that can be run on the servers of
partner companies behind their firewalls to extract key development indicators
for society, in a privacy preserving, commercially sensitive, stable, scalable
and sustainable manners. Hopefully, this cutting-edge approach to Big Data will
allow for more private and public sector partnerships to thrive, providing
better and deeper insights to policy makers around the world.

So, it's clearly not all doom and gloom when it comes to data exploitation. In
fact, many innovation teams in private and public sector organizations are
regularly lobbying to implement disruptive data projects with a social impact -
as we can see in the examples above. However, to make Big Data for Social Good a
real success, it is fundamental to find sustainable business models which allow
these data analyses to become recurring projects, not just one off pilots or
exploratory academic work. Taking a data-driven approach to the world's biggest
problems is fundamental and regular measurement of our collective progress on
the 17 Sustainable Development Goals is crucial in enabling policy makers to
mould their decisions in the most responsible and effective way possible.
