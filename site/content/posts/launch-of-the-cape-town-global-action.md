The
[Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/cape-town-global-action-plan/)
was launched at the first United Nations World Data Forum. The Plan calls for a
commitment by governments, policy leaders and the international community to
undertake key actions under six strategic areas, including: coordination and
leadership; innovation and modernization of national statistical systems;
dissemination of data on sustainable development; building partnerships; and
mobilizing resources.

The Action Plan has been under development for the past year by statistical
experts in a high-level group with inputs from stakeholders from the different
data communities, and will be formally approved by the
[United Nations Statistical Commission at its 48th](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/48th-session/)
session in March.
