On February 26th, the
[Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems](https://crvssystems.ca/)
at the [International Development Research Centre (IDRC)](https://www.idrc.ca/)
and its partners hosted a high-level panel and technical consultation sessions
on gender and CRVS
["Making the Invisible Visible: CRVS as a basis to meeting the 2030 Gender Agenda"](https://crvssystems.ca/sites/default/files/inline-files/IDRC_CRVS_Gender_Report_Final_EN_1.pdf).
The meeting was the first of its kind to focus solely on the gender dimensions
of CRVS systems and the barriers women and girls face when registering vital
life events.

Six months have passed since that meeting and, with hundreds descending on Dubai
to discuss the role of data in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), the United Nations World Data Forum presents a unique opportunity to
reignite the conversations around CRVS and gender. The Centre of Excellence for
CVRS plans to take full advantage of the rare occasion where statisticians,
civil registrars, gender experts, and policy-makers are all gathered under one
roof.

CRVS systems are particularly beneficial to women and girls, as vital statistics
provide sex-disaggregated demographic data on key issues such as population
distribution and maternal mortality. Because civil registration is continuous
and universal, these statistics are a powerful source of information on a
sub-national level at a more frequent interval than population censuses. By
providing proof of legal identity and social relationships, civil registration
also makes it easier for women to access crucial services such as health,
education, political representation, and to lay claim to inheritance and/or
property rights.

The impacts of a well-functioning system are beyond that of only the individual.
CRVS play a key role in assisting countries to measure and to meet their SDGs:
[24 of the SDG targets](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/crvs/Global_CRVS_Docs/news/CRVS_and_the_SDGs_2016.pdf)
and
[67 indicators](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/979321495190619598/pdf/115150-WP-CRVS-for-Monitoring-the-SDGs-web-version-May-18-2017-PUBLIC.pdf)
can be measured effectively by using data derived from well-functioning CRVS
systems. These systems are a must-have for generating the data countries need
for the "Leave no one behind" agenda. However, women still face many financial,
cultural, and legal barriers to realizing the benefits of CRVS, such as the cost
of registration; requirements of a husband's presence for a child's
registration; the system's failure to capture customary marriages; burial
practices; and inheritance laws. More understanding is needed to overcome these
barriers, specifically how to do so within a country's unique political and
cultural context.

Unfortunately, there is a dearth of strong case studies which explore the
successes or failures of these interventions. As such, there remains a knowledge
gap on proximate constraints and underlying factors that may influence the
registration of different vital events for women and girls. And while there has
been a growing recognition over the last several years of the importance of
strong CRVS systems, gendered barriers and inequalities are often overlooked.
Burning questions around CRVS and gender remain:

- **Examine barriers and hidden biases:** What gender biases exist in the legal
  systems that govern civil registration? How do the current legal frameworks
  discourage or prohibit women from registering vital life events such as their
  child's birth or their own marriage? What are cultural, economic or social
  barriers may prevent women and girls from registering their vital events?

- **Uncover the gaps:** Where are the registration data gaps? Where are women
  least likely to be counted, registered or recognized? How can we increase
  demand for registration among these vulnerable populations? How can we better
  engage men to ensure that vital events pertaining to their daughters and wives
  are legally recorded?
- **Develop a strategy:** How should countries register different types of
  marriages, especially those that are least likely to be registered or
  recognized? How can we develop evidence based strategies or design programs
  that facilitate registration of vital events for women and girls?
- **Build capacity, share knowledge and increase data use and impact:** How can
  countries strengthen their technical and administrative capacities? On the
  local level, how can registration authorities more efficiently register
  marriage and divorces? How can we increase data use and promote
  evidenced-based policy making?

Striving to answer the questions above, the Centre of Excellence for CRVS
Systems has set out to inspire a global commitment to integrate gender issues in
CRVS systems by continuing to discuss the status of the field, evaluating
opportunities and challenges, as well as identifying priority areas of research
and action to strengthen CRVS systems. We are looking forward to participating
in several sessions on the topic in Dubai specifically _"A new era for Civil
Registration and Vital Statistics systems: innovation and transformation to
develop capacities, reduce gender inequities, and improve data for the SDGs"_,
on Wednesday 24 Oct 2019.

Alongside our partners [Open Data Watch](https://opendatawatch.com/), we will
also be launching a compendium of
["Knowledge Briefs on Gender and CRVS"](https://crvssystems.ca/sites/default/files/inline-files/CRVS_Gender_1.3_Harnessing%20CRVS%20Systems_e_WEB.pdf).
The purpose of the knowledge briefs is to share and promote research and policy
papers in gender and CRVS, and to synthesize, publish and socialize key
messages, innovative case examples and emerging findings. The knowledge briefs
will serve to promote the adoption of good practices by keeping the dialogue on
the importance of CRVS systems for the global gender agenda ongoing. The Centre
of Excellence for CRVS is working to connect and convene relevant stakeholders
to ensure that CRVS systems count, work for and empower women and girls
everywhere. The United Nations World Data Forum in Dubai is the perfect platform
to do just that.
