Does your inbox look anything like this these days: "The protection of your data
is important for us"; "Updates to our terms of services"; "Important update of
our privacy policy"? Why are tech giants, retailers, banks, mobile phone
operators and others suddenly so interested in improving the privacy of my
personal data? I did a little survey among relatives and friends to test their
theories. My son told me it was a consequence of the recent Facebook, Cambridge
Analytica data scandal. Some friends had no clue at all. As I myself was unsure
if the messages required any action, I also asked if and how they were
responding. Quite a few postponed reading their emails ("no time right now"),
except for those where they needed to check a box to keep accessing a website or
service. Many did nothing at all.

The more data-savvy folks mentioned the
[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en).
This European Union law, which came into effect on 25 May 2018, requires all
public and private institutions to improve the effectiveness of data protection,
increase transparency on what they do with our data, and provide active choices
for users about what data they want to share. Interestingly, the GDPR email
messages were actually quite varied in nature. Some said, "We protect your
private data, don't worry" with lots of links to the company's privacy policies,
a 50+ page document that feels as attractive to read as the stipulations of my
car insurance contract. Sometimes, there was a short summary that simply
explained what the company had done, requiring no action from the user. A few
companies, including Facebook and LinkedIn, offered an even more sophisticated
menu of options that allows users to decide what they want to share before
continuing. Very few of my colleagues (nor myself) have used this option. How
can users be expected to understand all of this? Moreover, do I really have a
choice if I want to keep using their service?

While the GDPR seems like a necessary step in reclaiming our "agency" to manage
privacy in a data 4.0 world, it is not sufficient. Over lunch, a colleague
recently made a profound, disruptive and revolutionary proposal: What if the
companies that hold the majority of our private data were to pay us for it?

At first this sounds a bit crazy and possibly unrealistic. After all, data
companies are offering us free access to many tools and services, from online
street maps to professional networks and dating apps. But as they say, there is
no free lunch. Many people are starting to realize there exists a trade-off
between our data and privacy and the "free" tools and services these websites
and data companies provide. This is where discussions around
[paying users for their data](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/business/economy/user-data-pay.html)
have begun. Recently, one user in the United Kingdom even
[offered to sell his Facebook data on eBay](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3k4ay8/sell-facebook-data-ebay-oli-frost).
It is true that there is an unlimited hunger for our data in view of the
forthcoming artificial intelligence revolution: to train robots and do machine
learning, you need lots of data. Hence, the demand for our data will only
continue to rise.

With the enactment of GDPR, we are now at a tipping point, and in some parts of
the web, one model is already emerging. Look at YouTube. They pay vloggers for
their uploaded videos through ad revenue, which has been a huge incentive in
attracting more people to watch and contribute to the platform. Another model
could involve the adoption of a
["data tax"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/chris-hughes-facebook-google-data-tax-regulation),
which would charge companies that profit from user data. Certainly, if our data
becomes a traded good with a real price, we will all finally make the effort to
find out what happens to it, where it is stored, with whom it is shared, what
gets re-sold, and where the mash-up and merging with other data takes place.
Money will make us act and ensure that we finally take data privacy as seriously
as we should. And companies will benefit, too, through better quality data that
will instigate further innovation.

Regardless of the approach, the details of how we get financial compensation or
other goodies beyond access to a free service must be worked out, as does the
transition to a new model. More debate on this is needed, and the 2018 United
Nations World Data Forum from 22-24 October in Dubai, will be an ideal forum to
continue these discussions. I look forward to sharing my views on the right to
privacy, data protection and transparency, and the overall business model and
learning what others, such as the United Nations, World Bank and other partners,
think of these ideas. While most of us have not yet taken any concrete actions
following the GDPR, the genie is now out of the bottle. Data producers were
forced to respond and adjust to the new legislation. Now it is time for the data
community to follow suit and determine how these changes will affect us as both
organizations and individuals.
