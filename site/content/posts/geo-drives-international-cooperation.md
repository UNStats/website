In 2014, the United Nations Secretary General's Independent Expert Advisory
Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development
[defined key actions that were needed to advance a data revolution in support of sustainable development](http://www.undatarevolution.org/report/).
These actions included determining how key data gaps could be filled and
strengthening national statistics capabilities through new data sources and
innovation. The
[Group on Earth Observations (GEO)](http://www.earthobservations.org) is
actively undertaking efforts in both areas.

For the past decade, GEO has been working on behalf of 105 member governments to
connect the demand for sound and timely environmental information with the
supply of data and information about the Earth. GEO's approach to achieving this
mission has evolved alongside rapid changes in frontier technologies and has
been aided by exponential increases in the availability of open data.

## Building on the first United Nations World Data Forum

The first United Nations World Data Forum launched a global action plan that
aimed to facilitate better data to improve lives, new approaches to boost
collaboration, and increased resources and new policies to implement it.
[The Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/Cape-Town-Global-Action-Plan/)
calls on governments, policy leaders and the international community to
undertake key actions in several strategic areas necessary to fully implement
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These areas include:

- innovation and modernization of national statistical systems,
- dissemination of data on sustainable development,
- building partnerships, and
- mobilizing resources.

The global GEO community has responded to the calls of the Cape Town Global
Action Plan through several initiatives, including active contributions to the
[Global Partnership on Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD)](http://www.data4sdgs.org/),
and GEO's
[Earth Observations for the Sustainable Development Goals (EO4SDG)](http://eo4sdg.org/)
initiative. Both initiatives have focused on key elements of the 2030 Agenda, in
particular the value and usefulness of Earth observations for responding to the
challenges and opportunities associated with the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs).

With over 1,400 data experts from more than 100 countries at the first United
Nations World Data Forum, the upcoming event in Dubai, which we hope will
attract increased interest from a diverse array of data experts, provides a
unique opportunity to further progress. It will be an important platform to
showcase ongoing efforts and achievements, especially for National Statistical
Offices, one of the major core audiences and groups of participants. This means
building on collaborations around the world with EO4SDG and the
[United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM)](http://ggim.un.org/).

Ongoing work with GPSDD will also be presented, for example the international
partnership working on the
[Africa Regional Data Cube](https://gogeomatics.ca/from-australia-to-africa-data-cube-technology-empowers-governments-to-reach-development-goals/)
(ARDC) in Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Tanzania with the Committee on
Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), Amazon Web Services and Strathmore
University in Nairobi, Kenya. The ARDC is based on the
[Open Data Cube Initiative](https://www.opendatacube.org/), managed by CEOS,
which builds on the original open source framework developed in Australia that
organizes large amounts of open satellite imagery datasets over space and time.
These data cubes are being established around the world, with almost 40
countries at different stages of maturity. The
[world's first regional data cube recently launched in Africa](http://www.data4sdgs.org/index.php/initiatives/africa-regional-data-cube),
and plans are to use the data cubes as a resource for the SDG work, particularly
on indicators
[6.6.1 (water-related ecosystems)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=6&Target=6.6),
[11.3.1 (ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=11&Target=11.3),
and
[15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=15&Target=15.3).

GEO is leveraging these advances through its international
[work programme](http://earthobservations.org/geoss_wp.php), where many of the
70+ activities are strongly aligned with the SDGs. Through this programme, GEO
is helping national governments and statistical agencies incorporate Earth
observation data into their policies and processes. Other GEO members and
partners that have talks planned at the 2018 United Nations World Data Forum
include the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int),
[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [CODATA](http://www.codata.org/),
[CIESIN](http://www.ciesin.org/), [ICSU](https://council.science/), the
[Joint Research Centre of the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en),
United Nations agencies and several Member States. Each will be talking about
their involvement in international projects linked to sustainable development.

## A global movement for data providers and users for good

As a key outcome of the upcoming United Nations World Data Forum, GEO hopes to
continue driving forward the global conversation around improving access to, and
understanding of, open Earth observation data and information for national
sustainable development processes.

Sitting at the nexus of the first data and fourth industrial revolutions, GEO
helps the global community navigate the complex ecosystem of big Earth data,
highlighting the value and potential of open Earth observation data and
information for decision making. The partnership focuses these efforts on three
key global policy frameworks: the 2030 Agenda, the
[Paris Climate Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement)
and the
[Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/sendai-framework).
Work is also underway to highlight the value and usefulness of Earth
observations to support the
[New Urban Agenda](http://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/).

Through the
[Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) Platform](http://www.geoportal.org),
the GEO community provides access to more than 400 million open Earth
observation data and information resources that can support research, policy and
decision making for many of the SDGs, including agriculture and food security,
climate change mitigation and adaptation, disaster risk reduction and water
resources management.

Earth observations include measurements and information relating to activities
in, on or around the Earth. Whether space-based (e.g. satellites) or in-situ
(e.g. ocean buoys), the importance of Earth observations for decision making in
key global policy arenas is gaining recognition around the world. Recent
articles in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01303-y), the
[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/6df2befe-cb00-11e7-8536-d321d0d897a3)
and [Devex](https://pages.devex.com/satellites-for-sustainability) showcase that
this issue is leaving the scientific realm and entering mainstream
consciousness. The
[World Economic Forum recently focused on the increased ability to access data from the many public and private sector satellites orbiting the Earth](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/earthtime-the-new-tool-to-watch-the-planet-change/),
as well as innovative new methods for processing data.

Democratized data collection, production, management, access, use and sharing
all key aspects of GEO's work enable all sectors to make use of the vast Earth
observation data resources that exist, hopefully leading to better decisions
that affect lives, economies and the environment.
