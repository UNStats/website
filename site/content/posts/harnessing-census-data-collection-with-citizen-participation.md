In the spirit of the
[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld),
a great diversity of stakeholders needs to be summoned to make available
inclusive, disaggregated and valuable data for the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). Although the core of the efforts for the 2030 Agenda are led by National
Statistical Offices (NSOs), official statisticians need to give a more serious
consideration to all the qualitative initiatives coming from civil society to
aid in the endeavour of producing data to follow-up and review progress towards
achieving the SDGs. In fact, a wider data ecosystem is greatly needed to start a
real data revolution.

An
[ideal data ecosystem](https://blog.okfn.org/2011/03/31/building-the-open-data-ecosystem/)
is a well articulated system of stakeholders involved in the entire information
cycle for statistics, including a myriad of data agents, like source data and
statistics producers, info-mediaries, IT developers, data visualization experts,
and end-users of data. Eventually, a healthy ecosystem will yield data in a
reusable format, with a final value higher than the original source.

Most NSOs from around the world are leading data producers, sometimes
intermediate agents and in some other cases excellent data disseminators.
However, most of them still need to adopt, desperately in some cases, more
innovative data management approaches. Many actors are revolting the data
ecosystem scene. For instance, civil society has evolved and a new generation of
civic tech activists is beginning to lead the path to public engagement in
nationwide projects, like health campaigns, urban planning data collection or
humanitarian relief. The newcomers are promoting along with governments of all
levels collaborative and data focused projects, together with opening data and
enriching the production of data and statistics for SDGs with more diverse and
disaggregated sources. The next census round is a perfect opportunity to take
advantage of the growing empowerment of enthusiastic grassroots organizations
prepared to boost the process of a fruitful SDG data harvest.

These tools, especially those that are geo referenced, are showing an increasing
value in the endeavour for a solid SDG data infrastructure in the most diverse
countries: the United States Government included last year in an SDG statement
the launching of a unilateral commitment to
["innovating with open geographic data"](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/09/262294.htm)
for the SDGs. Similarly, [DANE](https://www.dane.gov.co/), the Colombian NSO, is
planning to use geospatial data and at the same time asking business chambers to
crowd source databases in order to jointly calculate SDG indicators. Kenya's
government, in turn, is largely focusing on spatial planning and involving
citizens in the heart of its strategic process for addressing the SDGs. On a
different, but more global level, a report of the Secretary-General at the 49th
session of the United Nations Population Commission recognizes that
"geo-referencing is a considerable ally for the SDG endeavour because it can
integrate diverse datasets with the incorporation of big data in analyses and
modeling."

When considering the disaggregation of territorial issues and given the right
conditions, citizen-driven data for census collection can be really helpful,
especially if it reaches out the more vulnerable communities. A real empowerment
can gain adepts for the generation of geo data largely benefiting the
[shrinking budgets of NSOs](https://paa2015.princeton.edu/papers/153763)
worldwide, especially in poorer countries.

Although these are all inspiring signs, a data revolution will need a more
proactive support if we want it to overcome the curse of just being a buzz word:
many NSOs across the world consider the data revolution in general, and open geo
data initiatives in particular, as little more than a tech eccentricity or as
some kind of novelty restricted for the time being to specialized practitioners.
Not surprisingly, one common practice among NSOs when it comes to updating geo
data for the census preparation is to take advantage of
[commercial and proprietary code platforms](https://www.cepal.org/es/eventos/censos-la-ronda-2020-potencialidades-limitaciones-frente-objetivos-desarrollo-sostenible-la),
especially using available satellite images or a low cost account, with the
promise of free of charge data.

While these practices may seek to lower census cartography costs, they can also
hamper the diversification of sources and the access to local knowledge. In
contrast, the use of non-commercial and easily accessible geo data initiatives
from civil society can help avoid this risk. Open data advocates like
[GeoCensos](http://www.geocensos.com),
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) or
[Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/) are working in the geo data
revolution already, mostly focusing in the realms of humanitarian aid and in
some cases raising development issues.

These civic tech collectives have taken the open geo data endeavour for the
benefit of large vulnerable populations. Their action can also aid the census
collection process leveraged by a vibrant open data advocacy bringing added
values, accessibility, transparency and a minimum statistical quality to enable
the harvesting, use and reuse of geo data for the welfare of their countries.
Unfortunately, these efforts have not been regularly monitored, or in some cases
not even witnessed, by the national statistics systems, especially in the
[Global South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_South).

As part of the civil society, our own perception of this reality is that the
data revolution needs a more decisive effort to advance in the scanning,
promotion, proactive support and multi stakeholder development of projects of
this nature, already available from open civil society platforms and derived
initiatives. Compared to the higher costs that commercial solutions have
especially
[in terms of accessibility and scalability](https://geo.intetics.com/geo-blog/commercial-vs-open-source-a-comparison-of-gis-software),
citizen data-driven initiatives can also prove efficiency, quality and local
representativeness. If well understood, a set of good practices from civil
society for NSOs may be readily available for the census data collection based
on more diverse, valuable, disaggregated and efficient solutions. We firmly
believe that the United Nations World Data Forum taking place 15-18 January 2017
in Cape Town, South Africa, will also embrace the ideas from actors coming from
civic grassroots movements to start a joint geo data revolution and map together
a better world.
