On the quest to establish and adapt the current data ecosystems to reflect the
global sustainable development agenda and the
[Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs),
it has become essential to look beyond official data. The sustainability
information that businesses disclose, whether on their environmental, social or
financial impact, can contribute to a more complete picture of progress on the
SDGs. Yet, the question remains: how can we include business data on the SDGs
within the current systems that measure progress?

As stated in the 2014 report
[A World that Counts](http://www.undatarevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A-World-That-Counts.pdf),
"Data are the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for
accountability". The United Nations World Data Forum gathers global actors to
discuss the most pressing data challenges facing the world, such as capacity
development for better data and the complementarity of different data sources.
In the run up to the 2018 United Nations World Data Forum, we would like to
highlight a pilot project we ran in Colombia at the beginning of the year that
tries to address some of these challenges and we hope will inspire further
action.

Colombia's [Departamento Nacional de Planeación (DNP)](https://www.dnp.gov.co/),
the country's planning department, decided to try to incorporate business data
in its second
[voluntary national review (VNR)](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/vnrs/)
that was presented at the 2018 United Nations High Level Political Forum.
Together with
[UNDP's Business Call to Action](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/partners/private_sector/BCTA.html),
and with technical support from the
[Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)](https://www.globalreporting.org/), it looked
at an innovative way to unlock the potential of non-government statistical data.
The business SDG-related data available through corporate sustainability
reporting was mined and aggregated at the national level, enriching the review
process on progress on the SDGs and enabling the participation of companies,
business associations, civil society and other stakeholders.

Project partners kicked off the initiative by convening a multi-stakeholder
committee which included, among others, the Competitive Council for the Private
Sector, the [Bogota Chamber of Commerce](https://www.ccb.org.co/en),
[Cepei](http://cepei.org/), large national corporations, business and industry
networks, the [National Statistical Office (DANE)](https://www.dane.gov.co/) and
other relevant national authorities.

The project partners first identified key topics to limit the assessment to a
manageable data set. The selection was based on Colombia's priorities, including
the national Green Growth Plan, for which business data was already collected
but not yet linked to SDG targets, and business indicators, as well as the
technical analysis of common indicators of the 88 SDG targets that require the
private sector's contribution and the five SDGs under thematic review. GRI
provided technical support to subsequently select eight corresponding GRI
Standards linked to five SDGs using the
[Analysis of Goals and Targets](https://www.globalreporting.org/resourcelibrary/GRI_UNGC_Business-Reporting-on-SDGs_Analysis-of-Goals-and-Targets.pdf),
which lists globally recognized indicators for the 169 targets.

The project partners then created an
[online tool](http://www.odsreportevoluntario.org/) to facilitate the data
collection process. Companies and other facilitating organizations at the
sub-national level filled in available information directly and through
different regional entities. To ensure conformity and alignment, the partners
developed methodological notes defining the scope and the expected data.

Data gathering was followed by data validation and analysis, with a multi-actor
team from UNDP and DNP. The
[main findings](https://assets.ctfassets.net/27p7ivvbl4bs/8XJw3xSMMMgw0qcYYiKsU/a4e9a5f4ee6128363faef7afe7bc395b/Private_Sector_and_Its_Contribution_to_the_SDGs-_A_Journey_to_Data_Gathering_and_Reporting_in_Colombia_DIGITAL.pdf)
were presented to the multi-stakeholder committee and were integrated in
Colombia's
[VNR](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/20338Colombia_2018_VNR_Espan771ol_1.pdf)
that was presented at the
[2018 High-level Political Forum](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf/2018).
Several factors made this endeavor possible and successful. First, there was an
auspicious corporate context in Colombia. Most large companies are GRI
reporters, which meant aggregating and mining data relying on the global GRI
standards was an easier task than if different reporting frameworks had been in
widespread use. Second, the private sector showed a willingness to participate
in meeting the SDGs and align with national priorities. Effective partnership
was essential for this project, and all key stakeholders came together to
realize this effort and asses Colombia's progress on the SDGs.

Acknowledging the unprecedented effort, and in the spirit of learning and
continuous improvement, the partners also drafted lessons learned to improve the
process and inform other countries. These recommendations included:

1. Improve the reporting process with companies through personalized follow-up
   mechanisms, facilitating the interpretation of records and their relationship
   with the company's economic and productive performance.
1. Increase reporting times and the analysis timeframe to address data
   consistency issues and confirm information with companies.
1. Use standardized data registration mechanisms, such as web-based tools, to
   reduce the chances of human error in data transcription and to save time in
   the aggregation process.
1. Have an SDG expert team by theme to improve data interpretation and enable
   report writing with a technical approach.
1. Strengthen the description of the requested information on each of the
   indicators, to reduce the risk of wrong or inconsistent reporting due to
   different interpretations.

More and more, governments are realizing the value of corporate social
responsibility and sustainability reporting: the number of VNR reports that
mention these items more than doubled, from 11 in 2016 to 27 in 2018. The next
step is unlocking the potential of corporate SDG-related data disclosed through
sustainability reporting. To make such data available, governments need to
encourage companies to disclose sustainability information, as called for in
[SDG target 12.6](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/), and
then to use this information to assess business contributions and impacts on
sustainable development and the SDGs. Only then can we truly reflect on the
business contribution to the SDGs, include it in measurement systems, and get a
more complete picture of the reality of implementation at the national and
global levels.

However, one key challenge remains: what is needed to allow this data to be used
by National Statistical Offices in the monitoring of progress on SDGs?

The United Nations World Data Forum provides the perfect platform to explore
this and other innovative ways to apply data and statistics to measure global
progress and inform evidence-based policy decisions on the SDGs. It is a
platform that can support discussion, data labs and interactive initiatives to
improve the use of data for sustainable development. We would like to encourage
all governments and National Statistical Offices to engage with private sector
data as a new complementary source. This, we hope, will also further strengthen
partnerships with the business community. We invite you to join our session
[Impact measurement, SDGs and support to official statistics – the role of private sector and partnerships (TA1.04)](/2018/sessions/ta1.04/)
on 22 October at 10.30 in the Ajman Stat Hall. We look forward to engaging with
you and exploring how to sharpen this pilot project to harness the valuable data
that the private sector has to offer.
