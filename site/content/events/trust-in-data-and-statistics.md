Building on the plenary session
[Increasing trust in data and statistics (TA5.01)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/undataforum/sessions/ta5-01-increasing-trust-in-data-and-statistics/)
held during the United Nations World Data Forum 2018 in Dubai, this webinar
continues the discussions on building trust in official statistics. In a world
with fake news and alternative facts looming around us, the public's trust in
official data and statistics is more important than ever. A better understanding
of the causes of a lack of trust can help strategically plan a path to building
and strengthening trust in official statistics. By integrating users and their
perspectives into all aspects of the data value chain, user needs will be fully
addressed leading to enhanced public trust in official statistics.

Our communal aim is to strive towards open data and avoid data gripped tightly
in private arms, to promote data sharing as a pragmatic reality, and to fully
resource, value and trust official statistics and national statistical systems.
There are important building blocks underlying trust in data and statistics that
should be cultivated to create a data system fit for our future needs. Such
building blocks include:

- Building strong organizational infrastructures, good governance practices, and
  multi-stakeholder partnerships.
- Following sound and internationally agreed data standards and principles for
  production, sharing, interoperability, and dissemination of data and
  statistics.
- Integrating users in the data value chain to meet their needs, increase the
  value of data and statistics, and ensure meaningful impacts.

Bringing together a panel of experts in the development data space, this webinar
tackles the issue of trust in official statistics and highlights ways toward a
trusted data ecosystem.
