[The Cape Town Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/Cape-Town-Global-Action-Plan/)
highlights the need for better data interoperability in the context of
innovation and modernisation efforts of national statistical systems. Responding
to this call, the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability was jointly
convened by the UN Statistics Division and the Global Partnership for
Sustainable Development Data after the first UN World Data Forum.

At the Data for Development Festival in Bristol in March 2018, the Collaborative
agreed to produce guidance on data interoperability for development
practitioners. This resulted in the launching in October 2018, at the second UN
World Data Forum, of the first version of a document entitled "Data
interoperability: A practitioner's guide to joining up data in the development
sector". The guide highlights how a systematic approach to handling data
interoperability issues can support both the achievement and monitoring of the
SDGs.

The guide was then presented at the 50th Session of the Statistical Commission
in March 2019, where the Commission recognized the importance for countries to
have access to interoperability tools and requested to continue developing the
guide.

[The Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability](http://www.data4sdgs.org/initiatives/interoperability-data-collaborative)
is now focused on the next phase of its work, focusing on building and
maintaining the Guide by adding new modules and practical examples as well as
ancillary materials to help raise awareness of its existence and usability. It
is hoped that new synergies will form between data producers, publishers, users,
and those providing capacity building and training. In this way, the guidance
set out within the Guide can be incorporated into existing training materials
and modules, and a consistent approach to the system-wide improvement of data
interoperability can start to become a reality in the development sector.

This webinar is an opportunity to learn first-hand from experts involved in the
production of the guide, and from country practitioners about the tasks ahead
towards improving SDG data interoperability.
