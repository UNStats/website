Addressing the challenges to meet the
[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld)
requires up-to-date and timely data to measure progress and make decisions to
improve people's lives. However, there are gaps in existing data, and too many
people are missing from the numbers. Bringing data sources together and creating
an enabling environment for the integration and use of non-traditional data
sources can fill this gap. This webinar will showcase how one specific type of
new technologies and non-traditional data sources, mobile positioning data, can
be used to develop innovative solutions to help fill this void in the data
landscape.

Representatives from the private sector, a national statistics office, and the
civil society will share how they leverage mobile positioning data to overcome
challenges and fill data gaps in specific areas, including but not limited, to
tourism and transportation.

This webinar is part of the United Nations World Data Forum webinar series and
provides an opportunity to learn first-hand from practitioners on finding
synergies across data ecosystems.
