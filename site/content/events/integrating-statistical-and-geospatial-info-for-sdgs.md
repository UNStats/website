Adequately and systematically utilizing alternative data sources and
methodologies, including geospatial information and Earth observations, presents
a unique opportunity to meet the ambitious demand of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. The importance of integrating geospatial information
with statistics in supporting social, economic, and environmental policymaking
was also recognized by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 2013, which
led to the establishment of an
[Expert Group on the Integration of Statistical and Geospatial Information](http://ggim.un.org/UNGGIM-expert-group/).

The Expert Group provides a forum for coordination and dialogue among
representatives of both statistical and geospatial communities with a view to
developing a global statistical-geospatial framework as a standard for the
integration of statistical and geospatial information. In this webinar,
representatives from civil society, international organization and a national
statistics office will showcase how statistical and geospatial information is
integrated to measure progress in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This webinar is part of the United Nations World Data Forum webinar series and
provides an opportunity to learn first-hand from practitioners on bringing data
sources together and creating an enabling environment for the integration and
use of non-traditional data sources.
