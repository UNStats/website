Today, there are many opportunities to deploy Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) data platforms to benefit decision makers so that actionable,
ready-to-use data, information and insights can be generated by national
statistical and geospatial systems for the implementation of the SDGs. By
expressing the SDG data and statistics in the form of interactive dashboard
visualizations, users are increasingly able to track progress at the global and
regional levels, and drill down to the national and sub-national levels to
obtain insights for decision making on the ground.

This webinar aims to showcase some examples of best practices on how countries
and international organizations are leveraging the use of technology and data
visualization to support policy and decision makers in the SDG follow-up and
review processes.

Based on the principle of national ownership, the webinar will showcase how
National Statistical Offices are leading the development of national data
platforms using internationally agreed standards and methods for the
integration, dissemination and analysis of SDG data and statistics, in line with
country-specific priorities. The webinar will highlight how a federated
architecture of interconnected global and national SDG data hubs is enabling
statistical organizations to publish and share authoritative SDG data and
information with each other, not only enabling users to access the data they
need, but also ensuring the traceability and accountability of the originating
data sources.

This webinar is part of the United Nations World Data Forum webinar series and
provides an opportunity to learn first-hand from global experts and country
practitioners on how technology helps make SDG data and statistics accessible
and user-friendly for better policy and decision making.
