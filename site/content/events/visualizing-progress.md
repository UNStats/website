Today, there are many opportunities to deploy Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data platforms to benefit decision makers so that actionable, ready-to-use data, information and insights can be generated by national statistical and geospatial systems for the implementation of the SDGs. By expressing the SDG data and statistics in the form of interactive dashboard visualizations, users are increasingly able to track progress at the global and regional levels, and drill down to the national and sub-national levels to obtain insights for decision making on the ground.

This webinar aims to showcase some examples of best practices on how countries and international organizations are leveraging the use of technology and data visualization to support policy and decision makers in the SDG follow-up and review processes.

Based on the principle of national ownership, the webinar will showcase how National Statistical Offices are leading the development of national data platforms using internationally agreed standards and methods for the integration, dissemination and analysis of SDG data and statistics, in line with country-specific priorities.
The webinar will highlight how a federated architecture of interconnected global and national SDG data hubs is enabling statistical organizations to publish and share authoritative SDG data and information with each other, not only enabling users to access the data they need, but also ensuring the traceability and accountability of the originating data sources.

This webinar is part of the United Nations World Data Forum webinar series and provides an opportunity to learn first-hand from global experts and country practitioners on how technology helps make SDG data and statistics accessible and user-friendly for better policy and decision making.
