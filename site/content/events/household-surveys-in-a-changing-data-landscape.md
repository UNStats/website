Household surveys play an important role in meeting national data needs, for
example, in measuring poverty, employment, education, food security, access to
health services and public services, discrimination and violence among other
topics. Household surveys are also critical for monitoring inequalities by
gender, class, location, disability and other markers of disadvantage; which is
critical for monitoring progress against the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). In addition, household surveys are an invaluable source of data for
behavioural and attitudinal measures which cannot be collected through other
sources like administrative data systems.

Despite their crucial role in national statistical systems over the past
decades, household surveys are now facing many funding challenges and scepticism
about their usefulness and adaptability to an ever-changing data landscape.

The webinar is part of the United Nations World Data Forum webinar series. It
will provide a platform for discussion on:

- the new role household surveys can play in a changing data landscape in
  addition to the traditional value they still have among other modes of data
  collection;
- how to unleash the full potential of household surveys;
- and on how national statistical offices and others can benefit from
  innovations to improve effectiveness of household surveys.

A more in-depth discussion on this topic will be covered at the forthcoming
Friday Seminar of the
[United Nations Statistical Commission](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/).
