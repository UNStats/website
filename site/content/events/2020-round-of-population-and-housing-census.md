Population and housing censuses have been used for centuries to provide a wide
range on information at various disaggregated levels on population and housing
units. They are regularly conducted in most countries and represent an important
source for reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals as well as to inform
policy decisions. However, given the scale and complexity of censuses, they are
exposed to vulnerabilities at various stages, especially during mapping,
enumerations and data processing. National Statistical Offices face a number of
challenges in conducting population and housing censuses, including decreasing
response rates, timely dissemination of results, and increasing data collection
costs.

Censuses, when combined with new technologies such as satellite remote-sensing
data, smart mobile devices, GPS and mobile connectivity, present opportunities
to improve how populations are counted and characterized with improved accuracy,
coverage, and timeliness. The
[Guidelines on the Use of Electronic Data Collection Technologies in Population and Housing Censuses](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/handbooks/data-collection-census-201901.pdf)
prepared by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), Department of
Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) present some of the new data collection
technologies that can be used to improve census coverage, data quality and
timeliness of census results.

The webinar is part of the United Nations World Data Forum webinar series. It
will highlight the use of the new of technologies in the 2020 round of
population and housing censuses and will provides an opportunity to learn from
country practitioners and the international community about the successful use
of contemporary methods in population and housing censuses in developing
countries.
