Following one of the main recommendations contained in the report entitled ["A World That Counts"](https://www.undatarevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A-World-That-Counts.pdf), presented in November 2014 by the United Nations Secretary-General's [Independent Expert and Advisory Group on Data Revolution for Sustainable Development](https://www.undatarevolution.org/about-ieag/), the [United Nations Statistical Commission](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom) agreed that a United Nations World Data Forum on Sustainable Development Data (referred to as United Nations World Data Forum) would be the suitable platform for intensifying cooperation with various professional groups, such as information technology professionals, geospatial information managers, data scientists, and data users, as well as civil society stakeholders.

The [High-level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-Building for Statistics for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (HLG-PCCB)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/) leads the organization of the United Nations World Data Forum, under the guidance of the United Nations Statistical Commission and in close consultation with Member States and international partners. The [Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://unstats.un.org/) supports the organization of the United Nations World Data Forum in its role as Secretariat of the Commission and the HLG-PCCB.

The first United Nations World Data Forum was hosted from 15 to 18 January 2017 by [Statistics South Africa](http://www.statssa.gov.za/) in Cape Town, South Africa. The second United Nations World Data Forum was hosted by the [Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority of the United Arab Emirates](https://fcsa.gov.ae/en-us) from 22 to 24 October 2018 in Dubai. The third United Nations World Data Forum will be hosted by the [Federal Statistical Office](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home.html) of Switzerland from 18 to 21 October 2020 in Bern, Switzerland.
