## Blog posts

- Blog posts should follow the editorial guide below.
- Blog posts require a title, but do not support subtitles.
- The body of your blog post needs to start with text, not with a heading.
- The first paragraph of your blog post is used as teaser for your blog post on the United Nations World Data Forum homepage and as page metadata for search engine optimization (SEO).
- You can optionally provide a different text as teaser and for SEO.
- You can use headings to structure your blog post.
- You can use lists with bullets or numbers to structure content.
- You can provide high resolution images (JPG or PNG formats) with captions that can be included between any two paragraphs.
- You can link any references you make in your blog post.

## Profiles

The following information is required for profiles:

- first name, last name;
- jobtitle, organization, and optionally link to your organization;
- high resolution profile photo (JPG or PNG formats).

Similar to blog posts, the first paragraph of your profile is used for SEO and you have the option to provide an alternative text for SEO.

## Editorial guide

The United Nations World Data Forum website follows the [OCHA Editorial Style Guide, third edition](https://www.unocha.org/publication/ocha-editorial-style-guide-third-edition). The OCHA Editorial Style Guide is a digest of the [United Nations Editorial Manual](http://www.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/) and empowers users to write better content. The following sections complement the OCHA Editorial Style Guide for the context of the United Nations World Data Forum.

- Specialized agencies of the United Nations system (such as UNDP, UNICEF, etc.),
- DESA,
- NGO/NGOs,

All other acronyms need to be spelled out in headings and on first occurence outside headings. This includes SDGs and NSOs.
