_Bringing data sources together and creating an enabling environment for the
integration and use of non-traditional data sources._

This thematic area addresses innovations and synergies across different data
communities by creating an enabling environment for the integration and use of
new and traditional sources of data. Sessions in this thematic area explore

- how to champion the changing role of National Statistical Offices (NSOs) as
  they move from data producers to service providers
- how to nurture collaboration between NSOs and non-traditional producers of
  data
- how to integrate geospatial information and statistics
- how to leverage opportunities and mitigate risks associated with use of big
  data and other new data sources

Sessions can also address data-driven algorithms for improved service delivery,
uses of machine learning and predictive technology.
