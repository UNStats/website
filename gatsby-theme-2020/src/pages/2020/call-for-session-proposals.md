## Selection process

The programme for the United Nations World Data Forum 2020 is being developed by
the [Programme Committee](/2020/committee/) comprised of members from national
statistical offices, academia, international organizations, non-governmental
organizations, civil society organizations, private sector, the donor community,
and geospatial information community. The Forum is organized around
[six thematic areas](/2020/programme/) . To help guide submissions, the
programme committee has developed guiding questions as examples of the types of
issues that could be addressed under the thematic areas. They are to help guide
in the proposals for sessions and to highlight some possible areas on which to
focus. However, the listed questions are not meant to exclude additional topics
or points under the thematic area. The list contains some aspects the thematic
area addressed, and is not considered exhaustive. Please incorporate how your
proposals address the various aspects of the thematic area in your session
description.

Proposals will be evaluated against a set of criteria to ensure that there is a
balance across the thematic areas, a wide range of topics under each area are
covered and different session formats are offered under each area.

**The Programme Committee will consider the following aspects when evaluating
proposals:**

1. Relevance and impact – session is aligned with the thematic areas and
   contributes to the overall objectives of the Forum;
1. Diversity – session speakers, presenters and moderator reflect geographical
   and gender diversity;
1. Data Innovation – session includes discussion of innovative data sources,
   approaches, method, partnerships;
1. Creativity – session design is likely to foster engagement/interaction with
   the audience;
1. Data communities – session speakers, presenters and moderator draw from a
   variety of data communities, and session is designed to foster interaction
   across data communities;
1. Concrete – Session showcases and discusses concrete experiences with data
   production and data use, and offers concrete recommendations or launch of new
   initiatives and partnerships.

Only proposals with a balanced gender representation will be considered. Also,
preference will be given to sessions that include diverse geographical
representation. Where possible, special emphasis on engagement with policy
makers and the inclusion of high-level speakers will be considered an asset.

The Programme Committee encourages collaboration and joint proposals bringing
together various data communities to strengthen the proposals and ensure a
diverse representation. Furthermore, the Programme Committee or the
[High-level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-Building (HLG-PCCB)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/)
may request revisions to some proposals, or for proposals with very similar
content and/or with the same speakers to be merged. Revised proposals are
subject to the approval of the Programme Committee and/or HLG-PCCB.

Please note that decisions about the inclusion of a session proposal is based on
the content and composition of proposal as well as the proposed session format,
when submitted. If there are significant changes to the session, in its
composition, focus, or session format, the Programme Committee and/or HLG-PCCB
reserve the right to cancel sessions.

The final programme will be approved by the UN Statistical Commission’s
High-level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-Building.
