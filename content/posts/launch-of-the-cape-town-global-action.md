The Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data was launched at the first United Nations World Data Forum.

The Plan calls for a commitment by governments, policy leaders and the international community to undertake key actions under six strategic areas, including: coordination and leadership; innovation and modernization of national statistical systems; dissemination of data on sustainable development; building partnerships; and mobilizing resources.

The Action Plan has been under development for the past year by statistical experts in a high-level group with inputs from stakeholders from the different data communities, and will be formally approved by the United Nations Statistical Commission at its 48th session in March.
